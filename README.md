<h1>Random Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
This project is a simple random password generator. 
I can put in any number as the variable, <strong>length</strong>, to represent the length of characters of a password and another variable, <strong>amount</strong>, as the number of passwords to generate.
<br />
<br />
Although the passwords generated are random, I can choose which password I like to give to a new employee who is logging into a company-owned device or a company-used website for the first time as a temporary password.
After logging in, the new employee will have to create a new password so I can't access their device or accounts.
